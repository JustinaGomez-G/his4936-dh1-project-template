# Workflow

Discuss (in detail) the processes of

* Getting the data
* Cleaning/altering the data
* Visualizing the data

When it came to researching and gathering data from the various databases, I ran into the problem of having too much data and I had to decide what I wanted to use and what I did not think was useful for this project. For me to do that I looked at how the information compared to the rest of the data from the other sources I used. What made it easier was the fact that I focused on the years 2000 to 2016, since most of these sources only went up to 2016 anyway.
Once I gathered all of the data I believed to be necessary, I downloaded it and used OpenRefine to clean it up if it was test and blah, blah, if it was a table or graph.
The websites I used for this project, like [UN Aids](unaids.org), are natioanlly and internationally known to have accurate information. This is important for any type of data gathering, but it is especially important when it come to health.  Some of the other websites that I used were

What you need to cover: Talk about every step in your process, talk about how and why you made the decisions that you did. Why did you pick the website that you did? Did you download every record, or just some? Did you download the data directly from the website, or did you use a tool like Webscraper.io? Did you use OpenRefine to change the raw data in some form, and if so, why did you change it the way you did? What program(s) or techniques did you decide on to visualize or analyze it? Why did you feel those programs (e.g. Tableau or Gephi) were better than other options, given your research interest? Did you have to do anything to the data inside Tableau?
